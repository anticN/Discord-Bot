# Discord-Bot
The bot is still in development but there are some functions and commands. To invite the bot in your server just copy the link below and paste in the browser and follow the steps.  
Note: To use all commands the bot needs to have admin permissions, just tick the box when inviting him to your server.

## How to use:
"§" is the prefix of the bot. Use "§help" to see all commands.

### Availability: 
The bot isn't hosted anywhere yet, so it's only available when I'm running it on my pc. But I'm planning to host it somewhere in the future.
